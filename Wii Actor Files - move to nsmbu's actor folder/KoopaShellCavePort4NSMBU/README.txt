So..., here is my port of the Giant Koopa Shell Cave model from NSMBW. 
Why a port, you may ask? This is because the Giant Koopa Shell Cave actor (alongside with a few others leftover from NSMBW) has the code leftover for it, it just crashes due to the models missing. 
It's not a perfect port, but its decent enough I'd say.  
I also included the invisible slopes tileset I used for the shell collision that I had to make myself since NSMBU doesnt have one.  
Put big_shell.szs in content/Common/actor of your NSMBU rom.  Then, import the tileset file into the 4th tileset slot with the Miyamoto Level Editor.
Paste in the following MiyamotoClip into Miyamoto for an example of how it is supposed to be setup: MiyamotoClip|0:0:1:1:49:37:3:2:0|0:0:1:1:45:45:1:1:0|0:0:1:1:49:47:3:1:0|0:0:1:1:55:45:1:2:0|0:0:1:1:45:46:1:1:0|0:0:1:1:56:41:1:1:0|0:0:1:1:44:41:1:1:0|0:0:1:1:45:41:1:1:0|0:0:1:1:55:41:1:1:0|0:3:4:1:55:39:1:2:0|0:3:4:1:54:38:1:2:0|0:3:11:1:52:37:2:2:0|0:3:5:1:54:39:1:2:0|0:3:0:1:47:37:2:2:0|0:3:10:1:46:38:1:2:0|0:3:10:1:45:38:1:3:0|0:3:2:1:52:38:2:2:0|0:3:1:1:47:37:2:3:0|0:3:4:1:46:45:1:2:0|0:3:11:1:47:46:2:2:0|0:0:1:1:46:46:1:1:0|0:3:0:1:52:46:2:2:0|0:3:10:1:54:45:1:2:0|0:0:1:1:54:46:1:1:0|0:0:1:1:45:47:1:1:0|0:0:1:1:55:47:1:1:0|0:0:41:1:47:47:1:1:0|0:0:41:1:48:47:1:1:0|0:0:41:1:52:47:1:1:0|0:0:41:1:53:47:1:1:0|0:0:1:0:45:42:11:3:0|0:0:1:0:45:41:11:1:0|0:0:1:0:46:40:9:1:0|0:0:1:0:47:38:7:2:0|0:0:1:0:46:45:9:1:0|0:0:1:0:47:46:7:1:0|1:267:800:736:0:0:0:0:0:1:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0|%
"invisitilesoverlay.png" is an overlay you can use to help visualize the shell collision, make sure to replace it with a transprent 960x960 image when finished
"1-1.szs" is a sample level you play to show that the backgrounds affect the shell lighting and to showcase the restoration, and you can view it in Miyamoto for your liking.
Feel free to use it in your projects. Credit is appreciated since this was fairly difficult to do. (Also thanks to Flizl for helping me on a couple of parts a bit.)
